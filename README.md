# hello-world
My first experience with GitHub
If you're reading this, I'm right behind you.
I'm just messing around with this because I want to learn how to program and I want to be good at it. I'm going to college soon and I respect the opensource culture, and don't want to just learn theory and whatever, I want to work on important and interesting projects on my own. I'm also a big fan of chocolate chip cookies and milk.
